# Maroon JSON VM Implementation Summary

## Overview

A stack machine implementation that executes JSON bytecode for computational tasks with state management, timing, and output capabilities.

## Components

### 1. **JSON Bytecode Format** (`maroon_dsl_design.md`)
- Stack-based execution model with states and operations
- Direct representation of stack machine operations in JSON
- Supports control flow, recursion, and timed execution

### 2. **JSON Schema** (`maroon_bytecode_schema.json`)
- Formal JSON Schema that validates bytecode structure
- Defines stack entry types:
  - `State` - Next state to execute
  - `Retrn` - Return address for function calls
  - `Value` - Stack values with typed expressions

### 3. **Rust VM** (`step13_maroon_json/`)
- High-performance async executor for JSON bytecode
- Implements complete stack machine with local variables
- Supports operations: push_stack, write, sleep, conditional, return, done
- Expression evaluation for arithmetic and comparisons

## Execution Model

```
JSON Bytecode → [Rust VM] → Output
```

## Stack Operations

- **push_stack**: Push entries onto the execution stack
- **write**: Output text with variable interpolation
- **sleep**: Delay execution for specified milliseconds
- **conditional**: Branch based on expression evaluation
- **return**: Return value to caller
- **done**: Complete execution

## Example Output

Running factorial(5):
```
0ms: f(5)
250ms: f(4)
450ms: f(3)
600ms: f(2)
700ms: f(1)
750ms: 5!=120
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Language-agnostic**: JSON bytecode can be executed by any language
2. **Debuggable**: Stack state and execution flow are explicit
3. **Performance**: Optimized Rust implementation with async execution
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new operations or expression types
5. **Portability**: JSON format works across platforms and architectures

## Testing

Run the Rust VM implementation:
```bash
cd step13_maroon_json
./run.sh
```
